# coevolutionary
Code used in the following two papers:

1) "A two-layer model for coevolving opinion dynamics and collective decision-making in complex social systems" by L. Zino, M. Ye, and M. Cao. International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, 2021, doi: 10.1063/5.0004787

2) "A Coevolutionary Model for Actions and Opinions in Social Networks" by L. Zino, M. Ye, and M. Cao. 2020 59th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), doi: 10.1109/CDC42340.2020.9303954

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2020a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). 

ORGANIZATION:

The project contains two main folders. The folder CHAOS contains the code used for paper 1), the folder CDC contains the code used for paper 2). 
CHAOS contains a set of files titled "Fig#", which genenerate the corresponding figure in the paper. 
CDC contains the file "script.m", which generates the simulation used in the paper.
The details on the parameters are reported in the paper and in the MATLAB code.
