INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2020a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). 

ORGANIZATION:

The project contains two main folders. The folder CHAOS contains the code used for paper 1), the folder CDC contains the code used for paper 2), the folder COEVOLUTIONARY contains the code used for paper 3).
CHAOS contains a set of files titled "Fig#", which genenerate the corresponding figure in the paper. 
CDC contains the file "script.m", which generates the simulation used in the paper.
COEVOLUTIONARY contains a set of files titled "Fig_#", which genenerate the corresponding figure in the paper. 
The details on the parameters are reported in the paper and in the MATLAB code.
